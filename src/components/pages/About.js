      <p className="cornbeef">As a graduate of the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, I’ve gained a unique perspective on the commercial art world through on-the-job training. My experience includes playing a key role in transitioning production departments to desktop publishing, which streamlined the entire process, allowing for faster and more accurate production of books. By implementing these changes, I was able to create more complex and visually appealing layouts, ultimately leading to greater creativity and diversity in published works.

In addition to desktop publishing, I also have experience in LAN implementation, designing, installing, configuring, and maintaining computer networks for small to medium-sized businesses. My proficiency in LAN protocols such as TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, and VLANs, and experience with network devices such as switches, routers, firewalls, and wireless access points allowed me to provide reliable and efficient network solutions that met the needs of the organization and its users.

Throughout my career, I have immersed myself in computers, software, networks, and web development. I have experience in package, book, magazine, newspaper, and web design, as well as advertising, marketing, and technical illustration skills. My interest in coding was sparked by creating web sites for publications, leading me to complete a full-stack development course at UCLA Extension.

With a background in creating the user experience and now, the ability to write the code behind the visual, I am well-equipped to take on new challenges and contribute to a team’s success.</p>
