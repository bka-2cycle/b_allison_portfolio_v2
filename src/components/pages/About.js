      <p className="hashbrowns">A graduate of the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, 
            I jumped into the commercial art world with no hesitation. Working part-time at an advertising 
            agency while going to school gave me a unique perspective on the road ahead. On-the-job training 
            pretty much sums up all my experience. There were two major transitions in the field of commercial 
            art (and the world in general) throughout my career, the first was computers and desktop publishing 
            and the second was the internet and cell phones. During these transformations I immersed myself in 
            computers, software, networks, web development and everything in between. Whatever came down the pike 
            I learned and applied in an on-the-fly environment. I have experience in package, book, magazine, 
            newspaper and web design along with advertising, marketing and technical illustration skills. 
            Web development was essential in the printing and publishing industry and I learned HTML to create 
            the corresponding web sites to many publications. Creating these web sites is what sparked my 
            interest in coding. After many years on the visual side of the web I am refocusing my career on 
            full-stack development. With a solid background in creating the user experience, 
            now I can write the code behind the visual.</p>
